# In this project, I will create a program to search for recipes based on an ingredient. 
# The project uses the Food2Fork API. 
# 
# 1. Ask the user to enter an ingredient they want to search for 
# 2. Create a function that makes a request to the Food2Fork API 
# with the required ingredient as part of the search query. 
# 3. Get the returned recipes from the API response 
# 4. Display the recipes for each search result.
